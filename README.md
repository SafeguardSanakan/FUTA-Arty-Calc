# FUTA-Arty-Calc
Simple mobile application that allows users to accurately compute artillery solutions.

A heavily modified version of [earthgrazer's foxhole artillery calculator](https://github.com/earthgrazer/foxhole-artillery-calc).

# Installation
1. Download or send .apk to android device.
2. Install & enjoy.

# Usage
- You will require binoculars (an in-game item) to effectively use this calculator.

1. Spotter determines the distance & azimuth to the target. Input this distance & azimuth into the calculator.

2. **Without moving**, spotter determines the distance & azimuth to the artillery gun. Input this distance & azimuth into the calculator.

3. Compute. Enter the **In-game Values** as accurately as possible into the artillery gun.

4. Fire & **have spotter watch**.
  * ** IMPORTANT NOTE:** This calculator **does not** factor in elevation or wind variables. It is entirely possible that your shells will *not* land where you want them because of differences in elevation variables between you and the target, or because of wind variables that cause your shells to be blown off course. The spotter will need to observe the impact of shells, and make **estimated adjustments** depending on where they land, and where they are supposed to go.

*The "Info" section of the application contains consise instructions for reference.*
